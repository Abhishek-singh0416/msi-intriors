  <section>
    <p>
      Welcome to <strong>MSI Interiors</strong>. These Terms & Conditions govern the use of our website, our services, and all professional engagements between MSI Interiors (“we”, “our”, “us”) and our clients (“you”, “your”).
    </p>
    <p>
      By engaging with MSI Interiors or using our website, you agree to these terms. We encourage you to read them carefully.

    <h2>2. Project Scope & Modifications</h2>
    <p>
      The project scope, deliverables, and timelines are clearly defined in our written agreements or project briefs.  
      Any additional requests, design changes, or modifications after project commencement may incur extra charges and timeline extensions.
    </p>

    <h2>3. Payment Terms</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>All payments must be made as per the milestones or schedule mentioned in the quotation or agreement.</li>
      <li>Advance payments are mandatory to initiate project work.</li>
      <li>Delays in payment may result in suspension of work until the account is cleared.</li>
      <li>All amounts are non-refundable once a project milestone is delivered or approved.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>4. Design Ownership</h2>
    <p>
      All concepts, drawings, and design proposals created by MSI Interiors remain our intellectual property until full payment has been received.  
      Unauthorized use, reproduction, or distribution of our designs or images without permission is strictly prohibited.
    </p>

    <h2>5. Confidentiality</h2>
    <p>
      We treat all client information, project details, and communications with strict confidentiality.  
      Any photographs or project visuals will only be shared publicly (portfolio, website, or social media) after obtaining written consent from the client.
    </p>

    <h2>6. Project Timelines</h2>
    <p>
      All project timelines shared are estimated based on current workload and vendor availability.

    </p>

    <h2>7. Material & Vendor Responsibility</h2>
    <p>
      MSI Interiors ensures quality in materials and vendor selection; however, natural variations in color, texture, or finish are expected in handcrafted or natural materials.

    </p>

    <h2>8. Client Responsibilities</h2>
    <p>
      Clients are responsible for providing accurate project requirements, timely feedback, and necessary approvals during each stage of the design and execution process.
    </p>

    <h2>9. Limitation of Liability</h2>
    <p>
      While we take utmost care in execution and delivery, MSI Interiors is not liable for any indirect loss, damage, or delay caused by third-party contractors, vendors, or factors beyond our reasonable control.
    </p>

    <h2>10. Termination of Services</h2>

    </p>
